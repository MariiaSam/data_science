EDA+ML_Modeling

- Import Libraries and Dataset

Install Pytorch Lib for importing the libs.

- Exploratory Data Analysis

Divide the features into Categorical and Numerical wise
Handle the missing values of features accordingly
Check the Duplication into the features
Check the Cardinality of the Cat Features and perfrom the Feature Engg if necessary
Check the data distribution of Numerical Features
Check the Outliers and tackle them accordingly

- Visualization

After cleaning the data make some relationship.
Make some graphical representation

- Machine Learning Model Creation

Encoding the Category Features first
Remove the unnecessary features
Scale the Feature
Model Training
Predict the Model
Check the accuracy score
Check the Overfitting and Underfitting
Confusion Matrix
Cross Validation...

- Results and Conclusion
